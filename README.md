# Stine Theme
STINE is the online platform used by students of the University of Hamburg. The design looks outdated and can be improved upon. This userstyle provides a design more aligned with the design of the other University of Hamburg pages. This allows for a more colorful design instead of the varying grey tones used in STINE otherwise.

The style is available at [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/174975/modern-stine-theme). For better documentation and issue tracking the source is mirrored here. 

The page [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org) performs very poorly and is often nearly unusable. Try the manual install below if it doesn't work. 

Disclaimer: The theme is unofficial and at your own risk.

Note: Some CSS is quite hacky and terrible due to the limitations of the original site.

# Manual install
If you haven't installed [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) install it in the browser of your choice.

Create a new style and copy the content of the `.css` into it. 

Set that the URL has to start with `https://www.stine.uni-hamburg.de`

Save and activate the style and it should show up on if you visit Stine.
